Abstract

We present an operational and falsifiable framework in which temporal structure is not fundamental, but emerges from correlations within a globally stationary quantum state. Building on the Page–Wootters (PaW) mechanism, we formalize a minimal set of postulates (P0–P4) that (i) recover effective Schrödinger dynamics for a subsystem conditioned on a physical clock, (ii) quantify clock quality under finite-dimensional and quasi-ideal clocks, and (iii) derive an informational arrow of time as the monotonic (in expectation) growth of an effective entropy for observers with incomplete access to environmental degrees of freedom. The central thesis is that the observer is not a privileged entity in the universe, but a local physical configuration in which global atemporality becomes operationally broken: time and its arrow arise only inside the observer’s coarse-grained description. A minimal demonstrator (clock + qubit + environment) reproduces coherent conditional dynamics in the absence of an environment, and effective decoherence with increasing entropy when inaccessible degrees of freedom are introduced. The framework is positioned within recent advances on temporal quantum reference frames, quasi-ideal clocks, and multi-observer emergent time.

1. Introduction

The problem of time arises at the intersection of relativity, quantum theory, and thermodynamics. Relativity denies a global present; quantum theory typically presupposes an external time parameter; thermodynamics introduces an arrow despite microscopic reversibility. These tensions persist not because time lacks a better definition, but because it is often treated as fundamental even where operational access is local and constrained.

We adopt an explicitly operational stance: a theory of time must specify which degrees of freedom are accessible to an observer, and under which physical constraints. From this perspective, two testable claims follow naturally: (i) effective dynamics arises relationally from correlations within a globally stationary state, and (ii) irreversibility is not a property of the global state but of restricted descriptions. These ideas are formalized below as postulates P0–P4 and implemented in a minimal demonstrator model.

2. Related Work and Positioning

Our framework integrates and extends three active research directions: temporal quantum reference frames and operational measurement theory; finite and quasi-ideal clocks with interaction-induced corrections; and informational arrows of time in extended PaW models. Key references include Hausmann et al. (Quantum 9, 1616, 2025), Mendes et al. (Universe 11, 308, 2025), and Shaari (Physics Letters A, 2026). We also note recent multi-observer relational approaches unifying relativistic and cosmological regimes (arXiv:2512.15789).

Our contribution is not a new PaW variant per se, but a unified operational pipeline linking conditional dynamics, clock quality, observer-limited access, and the emergence of an informational arrow, together with a clear ontological reading consistent with the formalism.

3. Postulates (P0–P4)

P0 — Global Atemporality (Constraint Form)

There exists a global state |\Psi\rangle satisfying a stationarity constraint
\hat{\mathcal C}|\Psi\rangle = 0,
where \hat{\mathcal C} is a global constraint operator (e.g., \hat H_C + \hat H_S + \hat H_E up to additive shifts). For finite-dimensional or quasi-ideal clocks, this condition is satisfied approximately, in the sense that \|\hat{\mathcal C}|\Psi\rangle\| is negligible within the operational support of the clock. Exact cancellation is recovered only in the infinite-resolution limit.

P1 — Factorization as an Operational Choice

A partition \mathcal H = \mathcal H_C \otimes \mathcal H_S \otimes \mathcal H_E is not ontologically fundamental, but specifies which degrees of freedom function as clock, system, and inaccessible environment for a given observer.

P2 — Relational Time via Conditioning

Given a clock readout |t\rangle_C, the conditional system state is
\rho_S(t) \propto \mathrm{Tr}{CE}[(|t\rangle\langle t|C \otimes \mathbb I{SE})\,\rho{CSE}],
with normalization by the probability p(t). Effective dynamics arises from correlations between C and S within |\Psi\rangle.

P3 — Emergent Schrödinger Dynamics (Good-Clock Regime)

When the clock resolution dt is small compared to the characteristic timescale of \hat H_S, and the clock dimension N is sufficiently large to admit a controlled continuum limit t_k = k dt, the conditional state approximately satisfies
i\partial_t |\psi_S(t)\rangle \approx \hat H_S |\psi_S(t)\rangle,
up to corrections quantifying clock imperfection and back-action.

P4 — Informational Arrow from Partial Access

For observers without access to E, define
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) = -\mathrm{Tr}[\rho_S(t)\ln\rho_S(t)].
Even under global unitarity, S_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) can grow monotonically in expectation for typical coarse-grainings and sufficiently large environments. Residual oscillations and recurrences are expected for finite environments but are suppressed as the effective environment dimension increases.

4. Clock Quality and Operational Metrics

Clock quality is quantified through resolution, back-action, and deviation from ideal dynamics. Finite clocks exhibit trade-offs between distinguishability of readouts and disturbance of the system, consistent with analyses of quasi-ideal clocks.

5. Minimal Demonstrator Model

5.1 Hilbert Space

\mathcal H = \mathcal H_C \otimes \mathcal H_S \otimes \mathcal H_E.
Here C is a finite clock with N levels, S a qubit with \hat H_S = \tfrac{\omega}{2}\sigma_z, and E an environment of n_{env} qubits.

5.2 History State

We construct a PaW-type history state
|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |k\rangle_C \otimes U_{SE}(t_k)|\phi_0,e_0\rangle,
with
U_{SE}(t) = e^{-i(\hat H_S + \hat H_E + \hat H_{SE})t}, \quad t_k = k dt.
Version A is recovered by setting \hat H_E = \hat H_{SE} = 0.

5.3 Environment Coupling

Weak couplings such as \hat H_{SE} = g\sum_j \sigma_z^{(S)}\otimes\sigma_z^{(E_j)} generate entanglement with inaccessible degrees of freedom. Conditioning on the clock and tracing out E yields effective decoherence.

6. Numerical Illustration

Without environment, conditioned observables oscillate coherently, reproducing Schrödinger dynamics. With environment, oscillations damp and S_{\mathrm{eff}} increases on average, demonstrating an informational arrow.

7. The Observer as a Local Breakdown of Atemporality

Observers are physical subsystems that partition degrees of freedom into accessible and inaccessible sets and store records. Time and its arrow arise only within such restricted descriptions. The observer is thus an anomaly, not a privileged center: a local regime in which global atemporality becomes operationally broken.

⸻

8. Predictions and Falsifiability

The framework predicts systematic dependence of dynamics and entropy growth on clock size, environment size, coupling strength, and operational partition, allowing experimental and numerical tests.

⸻

9. Limitations

The demonstrator uses simplified clocks and environments; extensions to quasi-ideal clocks and multi-observer settings are left for future work.

⸻

10. Conclusion

Time and its arrow emerge relationally from conditioned correlations under limited access. The observer is not central but local: the physical configuration where atemporality becomes operationally broken.
