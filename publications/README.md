## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[paper3.pdf](paper3.pdf)** | **Main paper.** *The Observer as a Local Breakdown of Atemporality: Relational Time and an Informational Arrow from Quantum Clocks.* Presents the postulate set (P0–P4), the three-pillar framework, numerical stress tests (gravity + structural robustness), and IBM Quantum hardware validation on ibm_torino. |
| **[essay.pdf](essay.pdf)** | **Philosophical essay (English).** *The Observer as a Local Breakdown of Atemporality.* A non-technical essay arguing that time is not a global property of the universe but an operationally emergent structure tied to local observers. Accessible to readers without physics background. |
| **[essay_spanish.pdf](essay_spanish.pdf)** | **Ensayo filosófico (Español).** *El observador como ruptura local de la atemporalidad.* Versión original en español del ensayo filosófico. |
| **[companion_notes.pdf](companion_notes.pdf)** | **Companion notes.** *Why Time Is a Problem.* A pedagogical walkthrough that begins with classical physics and builds step by step to the paper's framework. Designed for readers who want the full conceptual journey. |
| **[geometric_structure.pdf](geometric_structure.pdf)** | **Geometric interpretation.** Identifies the geometric objects (fiber bundles, connections, curvature) underlying the unified relational time formula and validates them numerically with the toy model. |
| **[god_observer.pdf](god_observer.pdf)** | **Boundary analysis.** *The Omniscient Observer.* What happens when the observer has full access to all degrees of freedom? Time and irreversibility disappear — confirming the formula's predictions at the boundary. |

## Relationship to the Repository

These documents describe the theory and results. The repository contains the code that **generates and validates** everything in them:

- Every figure in the paper can be reproduced with `python run_all.py`
- Every IBM Quantum result can be re-run with the scripts in `IBMquantum/`
- The [docs/](../docs/) folder contains the same content in Markdown (GitHub-native) format
