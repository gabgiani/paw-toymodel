Abstract

We present an operational and falsifiable framework in which temporal structure is not fundamental, but emerges from correlations within a globally stationary quantum state. Building on the Page–Wootters (PaW) mechanism, we formalize a minimal set of postulates (P0–P4) that (i) recover effective Schrödinger dynamics for a subsystem conditioned on a physical clock, (ii) quantify “clock quality” under finite-dimensional and quasi-ideal clocks, and (iii) derive an informational arrow of time as the monotonic (in expectation) growth of an effective entropy for observers with incomplete access to environmental degrees of freedom. The central thesis is that the observer is not a privileged entity in the universe, but a local physical configuration in which atemporality becomes operationally broken: time and its arrow arise only inside the observer’s coarse-grained description. We provide a toy model (clock + qubit + environment) that reproduces coherent conditional dynamics without environment, and decoherence with increasing effective entropy when an inaccessible environment is introduced. We position the framework within recent advances on temporal quantum reference frames, quasi-ideal clocks, and multi-observer emergent time.

Keywords: relational time; Page–Wootters; quantum clocks; temporal reference frames; decoherence; arrow of time; information; foundations.

1. Introduction

The “problem of time” appears at the intersection of (i) relativity, where time is observer-dependent and spacetime is dynamical, (ii) quantum theory, where dynamics is typically parameterized by an external time, and (iii) thermodynamics, where an arrow of time emerges despite microscopic reversibility. A standard diagnostic is that these tensions persist not because we lack a better definition of t, but because we frequently treat time as a fundamental background even when our most successful theories already deny a global “now”.

This work takes a deliberately operational stance: a theory of time must specify who can access what information, and under which physical constraints. We argue that once this is made explicit, two statements become natural and testable:
	1.	Relational time: effective evolution arises as a conditional structure within a globally stationary state.
	2.	Informational arrow: irreversibility is not a property of the global state, but of the observer’s restricted description; the arrow emerges from the growth of an effective entropy under partial trace.

We develop these claims as a compact postulate set (P0–P4), then implement a minimal demonstrator model.

2. Related Work and Positioning

Our framework is aligned with, and extends, three active research lines:

(i) Temporal quantum reference frames and operational meaning of measurements. Hausmann et al. compare consistent PaW formulations and clarify the operational meaning of evolution and measurement events relative to temporal quantum reference frames. (Quantum 9, 1616, 2025; arXiv:2308.10967.)

(ii) Finite and quasi-ideal clocks, interactions, and effective non-linear dynamics. Mendes et al. study PaW with gravitational interaction between system and finite-dimensional quasi-ideal clocks, deriving effective Schrödinger-like and non-linear equations with clock-induced decoherence. (Universe 11(9), 308, 2025; arXiv:2107.11452.)

(iii) Informational arrows of time in extended PaW models. Shaari extends a two-qubit PaW setting by introducing auxiliary degrees of freedom to model the observer’s incomplete access, leading to growth of an effective entropy and an informational arrow. (Physics Letters A, in press / available online Feb 2026; SSRN 5658980.)

We additionally note recent multi-observer emergent-time proposals that unify relativistic and cosmological regimes in a relational framework (arXiv:2512.15789, 2025).

Our contribution is not to re-introduce PaW, quasi-ideal clocks, or informational arrows separately, but to provide an integrated operational pipeline (P0–P4) plus a minimal demonstrator linking: conditional dynamics ↔ clock quality ↔ observer-limited access ↔ informational arrow. We further articulate the ontological reading that the observer corresponds to a local physical regime in which global atemporality becomes operationally broken.

3. Postulates (P0–P4)

We adopt a minimal postulate set to keep the framework explicit and falsifiable.

P0 — Global Atemporality (Constraint Form)

There exists a global state |\Psi\rangle satisfying a stationarity/constraint condition:

\hat{\mathcal C}\,|\Psi\rangle = 0,

where \hat{\mathcal C} plays the role of a global constraint operator (e.g., \hat{\mathcal C}=\hat H_C + \hat H_S + \hat H_E up to shifts).

P1 — Factorization is a Choice (Operational Partition)

A partition \mathcal H = \mathcal H_C \otimes \mathcal H_S \otimes \mathcal H_E is not assumed to be ontologically fundamental, but is an operational choice defining what counts as clock, system, and inaccessible environment for an observer.

P2 — Relational Time via Conditioning (Internal Clock Readout)

Let |t\rangle_C be a clock readout (ideal or approximate). The conditional system state is defined by

\rho_S(t) \;\propto\; \mathrm{Tr}{CE}\Big[\big(|t\rangle\langle t|C\otimes \mathbb I{SE}\big)\,\rho{CSE}\Big],

with normalization by the probability p(t). Effective dynamics arises from correlations between C and S inside |\Psi\rangle.

P3 — Emergent Schrödinger Dynamics (Good-Clock Regime)

In the regime where C is a “good clock” (defined below), the conditional state \rho_S(t) approximately satisfies

i\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,|\psi_S(t)\rangle \;\approx\; \hat H_S\,|\psi_S(t)\rangle,

or its mixed-state generalization, with deviations controlled by clock imperfection and back-action.

P4 — Informational Arrow from Partial Access

For an observer with incomplete access to E, define an effective entropy

S_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) \;:=\; -\mathrm{Tr}\big[\rho_S(t)\,\ln\rho_S(t)\big].

Even when the global evolution is stationary/unitary, S_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) can exhibit monotonic growth in expectation for typical coarse-grainings, defining an informational arrow of time associated to loss of accessible correlations.

4. Clock Quality and Operational Metrics

A “good clock” is one whose readout states provide near-orthogonal, approximately covariant time labels while minimally disturbing the system.

4.1 Resolution and Support

For finite-dimensional clocks, define effective time resolution \Delta t from the spread of the clock POVM and the density of distinguishable readouts over a support window.

4.2 Back-action and Disturbance

Define back-action via the conditional change in clock energy/number operator:

\Delta E_C(t) := \langle \hat H_C \rangle_{t} - \langle \hat H_C \rangle_{\mathrm{uncond}}.

Small |\Delta E_C(t)| indicates weak back-action.

4.3 Jitter and Deviation from Ideal Dynamics

For a target unitary U_S(t), quantify deviation by a distance measure (e.g., trace distance or fidelity) between \rho_S(t) and U_S(t)\rho_S(0)U_S^\dagger(t).

These metrics align with recent analyses of quasi-ideal clocks and effective non-linear corrections in interacting PaW settings.

5. Minimal Demonstrator Model

We present a minimal model designed to be calculable and to separate the emergence of time from the emergence of the arrow.

5.1 Hilbert Space

\mathcal H = \mathcal H_C \otimes \mathcal H_S \otimes \mathcal H_E,
with
	•	C: finite clock with N levels (e.g., truncated oscillator or finite clock basis),
	•	S: qubit with \hat H_S=\tfrac{\omega}{2}\sigma_z,
	•	E: environment of n_{env} qubits (inaccessible).

5.2 History State Construction

We construct a history state (PaW-style) by correlating clock labels with system evolution:

|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |k\rangle_C \otimes \Big(U_S(t_k)\otimes \mathbb I_E\Big)\,|\phi_0\rangle_S\otimes|e_0\rangle_E,

where t_k = k\,dt and U_S(t)=e^{-i\hat H_S t}.

Conditioning on |k\rangle yields the effective system state \rho_S(k).

5.3 Environment Coupling for the Arrow

To generate an informational arrow under partial access, we include weak coupling between S and E, e.g.

\hat H_{SE} = g\sum_{j=1}^{n_{env}} \sigma_z^{(S)}\otimes \sigma_z^{(E_j)} \quad \text{or} \quad g\sum_j \sigma_x^{(S)}\otimes \sigma_x^{(E_j)}.

The observer conditions on C but traces out E: \rho_S(k)=\mathrm{Tr}E\,\rho{SE}(k).

6. Numerical Illustration (Two Regimes)

The following regimes summarize the behavior observed in the demonstrator.

6.1 Version A — No Environment

Parameters: N=30, dt=0.2, \omega=1, no E.

Observed behavior:
	•	\langle\sigma_z\rangle oscillates approximately as \cos(\omega k dt)=\cos(0.2k), with amplitude \approx 1 and period \approx 31 steps.
	•	The resulting plot is a clean sinusoid for k=0\ldots 29.

Interpretation:
	•	Conditionalization on the clock in the history state yields coherent Schrödinger-like dynamics without requiring external time.

6.2 Version B — With Environment (n_{env}=4)

Parameters: same C,S plus E with n_{env}=4 and weak S\text{–}E coupling.

Observed behavior:
	•	\langle\sigma_z\rangle oscillations show amplitude damping and increasing irregularity (effective decoherence).
	•	S_{\mathrm{eff}}(k) increases on average from \sim 0.1\text{–}0.3 to \sim 0.7\text{–}0.9, with residual local oscillations.
	•	With larger n_{env}, the growth becomes more nearly monotonic.

Interpretation:
	•	The arrow of time appears as an informational arrow: a consequence of partial access to E, despite global stationarity/unitarity.

7. The Observer as a Local Breakdown of Atemporality

This section articulates the ontological reading implied by P0–P4 while remaining operational.

7.1 No Global Present

Finite signal speed implies that each observer accesses only its past light cone; thus, a global “now” is not an observable structure. What exists operationally are local events and the information that reaches an observer.

7.2 Observers as Physical Coarse-Grainings

An observer is modeled as a physical subsystem that:
	1.	partitions degrees of freedom into accessible vs inaccessible,
	2.	stores records (memory) of interactions,
	3.	updates internal states to reduce uncertainty about future interactions.

Under these conditions, the observer does not reveal a pre-existing universal time. Rather, time is constructed as an internal coordinate labeling conditioned correlations, and the arrow is constructed as the growth of effective entropy under partial access.

7.3 Anomaly, Not Privilege

The global universe does not require time, history, or experience to “exist” in the constraint sense (P0). The observer is a local configuration in which atemporality becomes operationally broken: by conditioning on a physical clock and tracing inaccessible degrees of freedom, the observer generates a temporal ordering and an irreversible informational arrow.

8. Predictions and Falsifiability

The framework yields concrete, parameter-dependent expectations:
	1.	Clock-size dependence: increasing N and improving clock covariant properties reduces jitter and improves agreement with ideal U_S(t).
	2.	Environment-size dependence: increasing n_{env} increases typical monotonicity of S_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) and suppresses recurrences.
	3.	Coupling dependence: stronger g accelerates decoherence and raises S_{\mathrm{eff}} growth rate, but can degrade clock quality via back-action.
	4.	Partition dependence: changing the operational partition C,S,E changes the experienced arrow; the arrow is not a global property but a property of restricted descriptions.

⸻

9. Limitations
	•	The minimal demonstrator uses simplified clocks and environments; quasi-ideal clocks and more realistic environments should be explored.
	•	The ontological language is constrained to operational statements; no claims are made about consciousness as a fundamental ingredient.
	•	Multi-observer consistency is treated at a conceptual level here; explicit two-clock simulations are left for future work.

⸻

10. Conclusion

We provided a compact operational framework (P0–P4) in which time and its arrow are not fundamental structures of the universe but emergent features of conditioned correlations under limited access. A minimal demonstrator separates (i) coherent emergent dynamics without environment from (ii) an informational arrow under partial access to environmental degrees of freedom. The resulting interpretation is austere: the observer is not the center of the universe, but a local physical configuration in which global atemporality becomes operationally broken.
