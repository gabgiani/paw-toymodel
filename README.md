## What Is This?

In quantum gravity, there is a deep puzzle known as the **problem of time**: the fundamental equations of the universe (the Wheeler–DeWitt equation) describe a *timeless* state — yet we clearly experience time flowing, clocks ticking, and entropy growing. How does time emerge from a theory that has none?

In 1983, Don Page and William Wootters proposed an elegant answer: time is not fundamental but **relational**. A subsystem of the universe acts as a "clock," and the temporal evolution of everything else is recovered by asking: *"what does the system look like when the clock reads t?"* This is the **Page–Wootters (PaW) mechanism**.

This repository takes that idea and extends it. We show that a single mathematical expression — the **unified relational time formula** — is enough to produce not just quantum dynamics, but also the **thermodynamic arrow of time** (why entropy grows) and **observer-dependent time** (why different observers can disagree about temporal descriptions). Three pillars of the problem of time, from one formula:

$$\rho_S(t) = \frac{\mathrm{Tr}_E\!\big[\langle t|_C\;|\Psi\rangle\langle\Psi|\;|t\rangle_C\big]}{p(t)}$$

The key insight is that the **observer** is not a passive spectator — it is a *local anomaly* in the global atemporality. By choosing a clock ($C$) and tracing over inaccessible degrees of freedom ($\mathrm{Tr}_E$), the observer *creates* the temporal experience. Remove the observer's limitations, and time dissolves back into the timeless whole.

### Three Pillars from One Formula

| Operation | What it produces | Pillar |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| ⟨t\|\_C (projection) | Schrödinger dynamics | Quantum mechanics |
| Tr\_E (partial trace) | Entropy growth, irreversibility | Thermodynamic arrow |
| C is local (not global) | Observer-dependent time | Relational time |

### What's in This Repository

Everything here is **numerically verifiable**. The repository contains:

- A **toy model** (1 qubit + up to 8 environment qubits) that demonstrates all three pillars
- **Robustness tests** showing the results survive gravitational corrections, different initial states, and Poincaré recurrences
- **IBM Quantum hardware validation** — the formula was tested on a real quantum processor (ibm\_torino), confirming the theoretical predictions with error bars
- A **boundary analysis** (the "omniscient observer") exploring what happens when you give the observer complete access — time disappears, as predicted
- **Geometric interpretations** showing how the arrow of time traces a path on the Bloch sphere
- An **independent extension** studying observational asymmetry between systems with different access structures

The mathematics draws on work by Page & Wootters (1983), Giovannetti, Lloyd & Maccone (2015), and Höhn, Smith & Lock (2021), among others. The synthesis — the three pillars from one formula, the observer as anomaly, and the numerical demonstrations — is original.

## Key Results at a Glance

### Pillar 1 — Projection yields dynamics

![Pillar 1](output/validation_pillar1.png)

The blue dots show ⟨σ\_z⟩ computed from the Page–Wootters formula at each clock reading *k*; the dashed black line is the analytic solution cos(ωk·dt). They overlap exactly (max deviation ~ 4×10⁻¹⁶), confirming that temporal dynamics emerge from projection alone — no external time parameter is needed.

### Pillar 2 — Partial trace yields the arrow

![Pillar 2](output/validation_unified.png)

Three panels, same formula with a 4-qubit environment added. **Left:** ⟨σ\_z⟩ now decays (green) instead of oscillating indefinitely — decoherence from the partial trace. **Center:** the von Neumann entropy S\_eff grows monotonically from 0 to ln 2 ≈ 0.693, defining the thermodynamic arrow. **Right:** direct comparison — Version A (blue, no environment, reversible) vs Version B (green, with environment, irreversible). The arrow emerges from the same formula by adding Tr\_E.

### Pillar 3 — Clock locality yields observer-dependent time

![Pillar 3](output/validation_pillar3_two_clocks.png)

Two observers choose different clocks (dt = 0.20 vs dt = 0.35) applied to the same global state |Ψ⟩. **Left panels:** ⟨σ\_z⟩ dynamics differ — faster clock (top) resolves more oscillations. **Right panels:** both observers see entropy grow to ln 2, but along different paths. Neither narrative is "correct" — both are valid relational descriptions.
